A Crucial and Crucible Catalytic ∱pace Technology for the Foundations of Life.

Core Objectives

» Honor the Possibilities We Carry for the Future.  
» Keep everyone as safe in ∱TEAM ∱cool as Sasha, Malia, and Mengzi, and build safeties for Justin Broglie, Aaron Hillel, Ilya Zhitomirskiy, and Ædam.  
» Obey the dictates of universal humanitarian conscience, above all, as this forms.

License
-------
Kohlberg Pathbreaker License 3.6 — Surrender of this technology set to the Office of the First DALY of United, and the Office of the Presiding Officer, for conscientious management, pending approval by Nomic Conventions of lifesaver labs.

This project would be either GPL'ed or MIT Licensed, but there are limitations built inside of these licenses that restrict the scope of action of a conscientious United IRB. For example, if this code were completely open-sourced, as one of our Core Founders pointed out, a voyeur could install a camera trigger attached to the SSC Console to capture still photographs or even video of a private encounter. Students might also might try to measure endurance brutishly, or hack herstorical or historical records of the most libertine that ought to remain fiercely protected by HIPAA standard machinery, but arguably, without the persistence of a HIPAA record. Students might do so out of transiently noble motives, then slip and slide into scarring privacy-invasive actions. To keep this from going into the hands of tyrannical, overly dry, or libertine personalities (something that I, frankly, fear I may slip into transiently from time to time, without repriming, while exploring improperly regulated and improperly understood play, work, ∱cool and home spaces in n-scale), I suggest that We keep this technology in the hands of the IRBs United, of which We/I may form a small part. We can make this gentle, and ever more ennobling, together, on behalf of, and with, the generations to come.
